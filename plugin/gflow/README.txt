This QGIS plugin serves to easily create model input for the GFLOW analytic
element model:

Analytic element input is typically a collection of points, lines, and polygons.
This plugin represents a single model with a single GeoPackage. The different
elements are represented as layers in the GeoPackage, and also as ordinary
vector layers in QGIS.
